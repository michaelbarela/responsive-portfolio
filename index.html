        <p>I am currently enrolled in the UCSD Coding Bootcamp. I was introduced to Web Design by my niece who, at the time, was coding in the 4th grade and was able to create a video game. Since being introduced, I have been hooked on learning more about web development and the countless tools that can help me create and design. I hope to use my skills and apply them in this course to gain the most out of it.</p>
        <p>My hobbies include: Boxing, Jiu Jitsu, Basketball, Football, Running, Hiking and Cooking. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle because our health is really all we have.</p>
